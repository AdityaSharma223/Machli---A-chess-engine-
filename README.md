# Machli - A chess engine



Machli is a simple beginnner level chess engine. 

#### The Vision: 

My vision with "Machli" is to make a simple and efficient chess engine, I am going to use Python to achieve this but I do plan on expanding it and implementing it in C++. 



(the name Machli<sup>1</sup>, if hadn't already guessed, has been taken from stock-"fish"<sup>2</sup>. )
