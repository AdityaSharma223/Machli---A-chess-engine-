# Machli - A chess engine



Machli is a simple beginnner level chess engine. 

#### The Vision: 

My vision with "Machli" is to make a simple and efficient chess engine, I am going to use Python to achieve this but I do plan on expanding it and implementing it in C++. 



(the name Machli, if hadn't already guessed, has been taken from stock-"fish". ) <sup>1</sup> 

[^1]: Machli (मछली) is fish in Hindi
